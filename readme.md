## Magic 8-ball

Provides an answer to a yes/no question, giving one of the twenty possible outcomes. No user input is needed.

Inspired by the movie "Interstate 60" :)

TO DO: run in an infinite loop, with user input after each outcome generation whether to continue or exit the program.

Future development: embedded device version, with either a tilt switch or an accelerometer to activate the outcome generation
(ideally gesture recognition, i.e. when the user flips the board upside down and back).
